* CropAPI
* accepts instructions to crop an existing image and create a new results
* returns 404 a nonexistent image
* returns 400 for bad request params
* returns 200 for accepted crop
* creates the cropped image


Copilot tab completed all the boring bits
guessed code correctly more often than not
copilot did not help much with image libraries

feels like it makes me lazy about investigating the libray apis, but eventually i have to go to them any way

i navigate api docs less

code completion was a help

ended up having too few tests for crop service
